Please implement the following improvements to the laundry dashboard project to finalize its security and bilingual support:

üîê 1. Add a simple password-based admin login protection:
- Create a `/login` route and a basic login page.
- The admin password should be stored in a secure constant (e.g., `ADMIN_SECRET`) in a separate config file (e.g., `config.py`).
- When a user logs in with the correct password, set a cookie (e.g., `admin_secret`) to maintain the session.
- All protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/orders`, `/analytics`, `/categories`, `/reports`) should redirect to `/login` if the cookie is missing or invalid.
- Add a `/logout` route to clear the session.
- Make sure this login system is simple and secure, with the password being hardcoded and only changeable by editing the source code.

üåç 2. Ensure full Arabic language support:
- Review all pages and templates to ensure **every label, title, button, form input, and section** is properly translated to Arabic.
- Check and fix any parts of the UI that remain in English when Arabic is selected.
- Ensure all dynamic content (like order status, item labels, export buttons, filter options, analytics charts, etc.) supports bilingual display.
- Implement correct **RTL layout** on all Arabic views.
- Update the language toggle logic to persist the selected language using localStorage and apply it across all routes.

üìù 3. Extra polish:
- Add a note in the replit.md file documenting how to change the admin password from `config.py`.
- Ensure that uploading, editing, deleting categories or items works the same in Arabic and English.
- Test export features (CSV/PDF) in Arabic mode ‚Äî file content and labels should be in Arabic and properly aligned (RTL where applicable).

Make sure the login page and all protected pages are also bilingual. Provide Arabic/English labels on the login form and feedback messages.

Confirm that the full dashboard is now secure and RTL-ready with proper translations and that everything functions smoothly in both languages.
