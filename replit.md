2. Order created with pending status
3. Admin updates status through dashboard
4. Real-time updates available through polling

### Category Management
1. Default categories initialized on startup
2. Admin can add/edit categories through dashboard
3. Image uploads processed and stored locally
4. Categories served to mobile app via API

### Analytics Processing
1. Real-time calculation of daily metrics
2. Historical data aggregation for charts
3. Commission and revenue tracking
4. Export functionality for reports

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework and routing
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and security

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library

### File Storage
- Local filesystem for uploaded images
- Static file serving through Flask

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Development Server**: Flask built-in server on port 5000
- **Host Configuration**: Configured for 0.0.0.0 to accept external connections
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development
- **Proxy Support**: ProxyFix middleware for deployment behind reverse proxy

### Production Considerations
- No persistent database (data lost on restart)
- In-memory storage not suitable for production
- File uploads stored locally (not cloud-ready)
- Session secret should be environment variable in production

### Scalability Limitations
- Single-threaded Flask development server
- No database persistence
- No user authentication or authorization
- Limited to single-instance deployment

### Admin Authentication Setup
- **Admin Password**: Default password is `laundry_admin_2025`
- **Configuration**: Change admin password in `config.py` file
- **Location**: Update `ADMIN_SECRET` variable in `config.py`
- **Security**: Password is hardcoded and must be changed in source code
- **Session Management**: Uses Flask sessions with secure cookies

### Recommended Production Changes
- Change default admin password in `config.py`
- Use environment variables for admin password
- Implement proper user role management
- Add password complexity requirements
- Deploy with WSGI server (Gunicorn) - ✓ Already implemented
- Add Redis for session management
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
